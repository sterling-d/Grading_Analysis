# Student Grading Analysis 

This repo utilizes linear regression to predict whether a student will receive a passing or failing grade. The grades are computed on a sliding scale between 1-20. 20 being passing and 1 failing. The factors used to determine a student's success include (but are not limited to) extracurricular activities, studytime, internet access at home and family educational support.

## Usage

To use the grading analysis application, simply clone the repository and create a new_folder to save your **tensorEnn.py** . Navigate to that folder within your terminal and open code in VS Code by typing the following:

```new_folder
   code . 
```

Upon launching the grading analysis application, you will be able to view a scatter plot that visualizes all of the student's grades and the percentage of those that have either passed or failed:
